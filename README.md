# OSU Web Development Coding Bootcamp Prework Notes

## Description

This project stores my notes from the OSU Web Development Coding Bootcamp prework.  It will allow other bootcamp students to review the notes and use them as a study aid.  I was motivated to build this project because I wanted to improve my own web development skills.  More specifically, I built the project to improve my own familiarty with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to learn how to properly use Git and Github.  While building the project, I learned about various types of HTML tags, CSS styling, Git commands, and JavaScript control flow structure.

## Installation

## Usage

This study aid can be used to briefly review the topics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.  The webpage contains notes on those four topics.  The project also contains a JavaScript script that will run each time the page is refreshed.  This script will randomly choose one of the four topics for a student to study first.  The student can view which topic the script chose by pressing F12 and opening the console.  The topic will be listed at the bottom of the console log.
